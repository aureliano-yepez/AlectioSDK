### Did you modify the folder `alectio_sdk`? If so, describe your changes in detail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, I've only changed my topic classification example so haven't modified `alectio_sdk`

### If you have made any changes to an existing example, please go through the following list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Example name**:  Topic classification

- [x] I have tried an end-to-end test (involving the front-end, backend, and AL engine) and it was successful
- [x] Loss, metrics, etc. look reasonable/consistent to me
- [x] If necessary, I updated related files such as `requirements.txt` and `README.md` 

### Describe your change in detail and any other comments
------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't changed anything fundamental, just updated the `README.md` with some new args since we're shifting away from hard-coding and making examples more flexible

### Describe any bugs or inconsistencies you may have encountered along the way
